## Topic: Comparative Performance Analysis of Pre-trained Models for Deep Fake Detection.

### Steps
1. Go to Youtube and search for "Hugging face in 15 minutes". Learn - How to use pre-trained models from hugging face, optimize it, tune it and deploy it.
2. Go to Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/models) and search for "Deep Fake". Explore 10-12 pre-trained models.
3. Identify your domain for deep fake detection i.e. image, audio/voice, video, text, etc
4. Run all the selected models and create the given below table:

### 5. Submission Guidelines:
   Choose any dataset (of image, audio/voice, video, text, etc) from any source (Kaggle, Hugging Face, UCI library, etc). Minimum dataset size must be 100 objects. Make the prediction from selected pre-trained models and apply emsemble. Create a shot report of 6-7 pages (similar to research paper, Reference: https://github.com/psrana/Sample-Research-Papers) only that contain
  - Title, Student name, roll number, email id and Abstract
  - 1 Introduction
  - 2 Background
  - 3 Description of the pre-trained models
  - 4 Evaluation Parameters
  - 5 Result analysis and Discussion
  - 6 Conclusion and Futute works
  - 7 References
